# TinyAPI Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Set up Rails project with necessary gems
- Created Payload model and migration
- Implemented rate limiting with Redis
- Created PayloadsController with add, edit, and get actions
- Set up configuration for expiry times and rate limits
- Implemented auto-delete job for expired payloads
- Added scheduler for running the auto-delete job
- Fixed database migration issues
- Implemented CRUD operations with curl commands
- Created API documentation (API_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- Updated expiry time logic to respect server-defined maximum
- Added README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- Added LICENSE.md with MIT License
- Updated .gitignore to exclude all sensitive and unnecessary files
- Removed tracked files that should be ignored
- Used git filter-repo to remove sensitive and unnecessary files from entire Git history
- Re-added remote origin after git filter-repo operation
- Set up RSpec for testing
- Created initial model tests for Payload
- Created controller tests for PayloadsController (add, edit, get actions)
- Implemented comprehensive tests using RSpec
  - Included model specs and controller specs
  - Used FactoryBot for test data generation

## To-Do
- Implement error handling for database errors and not found scenarios
- Set up Rubocop for code style enforcement
- Configure production environment

- Add more comprehensive logging
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Consider adding a delete endpoint for manual payload removal
- Refactor code to follow Ruby style guide (use Rubocop)
- Optimize database queries
  - Add necessary indexes
  - Use includes, joins, or select to avoid N+1 queries
- Implement caching strategies (e.g., fragment caching, Russian Doll caching)
- Use service objects for complex business logic
- Implement background jobs using Sidekiq for time-consuming tasks
- Enhance security measures
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization
  - Use strong parameters in controllers
  - Protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection)
- Improve API documentation
  - Add examples for each endpoint
  - Include error responses and status codes
- Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline
- Implement versioning for the API
- Add monitoring and alerting for production environment
- Optimize performance
  - Use database indexing effectively
  - Implement eager loading to avoid N+1 queries
- Enhance error handling and validation
  - Implement proper error logging
  - Display user-friendly error messages
- Refactor controllers to keep them skinny
  - Move business logic to service objects or model methods
- Set up Docker for consistent development and deployment environments
- Ensure all team members pull the latest changes and update their local repositories
